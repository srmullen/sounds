# Unit Generator Compositions

## Goal

I intend to learn all of the SuperCollider Unit generators. Learning about SuperCollider and digital signal processing is not the primary goal of this excercise however. A practical knowlege of SuperCollider and digital signal processing will be very beneficial, but I really hope to acheive a strong set of material on which to base larger compositions and also work on focus. I feel somewhat contradicting, because I still want to work on my music notation program, and I will, but jumping back and forth on a whim won't be an option. Useless distractions will be off limits. The aim is to acheive one composition per day. That will definately slip. Some days no work will be possible. I hope that other days I'll be able to get more than one complete. I don't want to rush anything though. If the focus of a composition is more interesting then it will get more time.

This is also going to be an opourtunity to work on writing and explanation. Everything should be well commented and all choices and inputs should be explained.
